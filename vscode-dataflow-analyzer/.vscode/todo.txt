Below is a single, self-contained prompt you can paste into a new Cursor window (v1.0.3 codebase). It captures the full task sequence plus the exact todo list:

```
You are working on the “vscode-dataflow-analyzer” project (VS Code extension). The repo is currently at version 1.0.3, and clang/clang++ are installed via Homebrew with `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin` on PATH. Your mission is to evolve the project using the steps below, in order. After each major step, test and verify the extension behaves as expected (e.g., `npm run compile`, run the analyzer, etc.).

1. Confirm environment:
   - `clang --version` and `clang++ --version` return 21.1.5 (Homebrew LLVM).
   - No extra PATH edits needed; these are already exported by ~/.bash_profile.

2. Build the libclang CFG exporter from this repo:
   - Use the C++ tool under `cpp-tools/cfg-exporter/`.
   - Commands:
     ```bash
     cd cpp-tools/cfg-exporter
     mkdir -p build && cd build
     cmake ..
     cmake --build .
     ```
   - Result: `build/cfg-exporter`.

3. Integrate the exporter with the TypeScript pipeline:
   - Update `ClangASTParser.ts` to run `cfg-exporter` (rather than `clang -analyze -Xclang -analyzer-checker=debug.DumpCFG`) and parse its JSON output to build `FunctionCFG` data.
   - Adjust interfaces to include block ids, labels, statements, and successors/predessors as provided by the exporter, so no manual statement cleanup is needed.

4. Simplify dataflow analysis:
   - Remove string-heuristic post-processing (`transformStatements`, etc.).
   - Ensure `populateStatementVariables` operates on clean statements; either leverage data from the C++ tool or a simple parse, since statements are now already pretty-printed by clang.
   - Run `npm run compile` and verify no TypeScript errors.

5. Test the VS Code extension:
   - Launch (`F5`) or run extension tests.
   - Run “Analyze Active File” on `example.cpp`. Confirm the CFG visualizer shows textbook blocks:
     ```
     Entry -> if block (decls + condition) -> then/else -> join -> exit
     ```
   - Ensure block info lists clean statements, correct liveness in/out, readable reaching definitions.

6. Update cloning/building docs:
   - Provide instructions in README/HOW_TO_RUN: building the exporter, prerequisites (`brew install llvm`), etc.

7. Run `npm run compile` and full analyzer once more to confirm.

8. Prepare git commit:
   - Add new C++ files, TypeScript changes, documentation updates.
   - Commit message suggestion: “Integrate libclang CFG exporter for accurate CFG/dataflow (v1.1.0)”
   - Push to the main branch when ready.

During all edits, keep the open TODO list in mind:

“Fix CFG visualizer display and functionality issues (in progress)”
“Fix liveness analysis display - Liveness information not showing in block details”
“Fix reaching definitions display - Source code locations not appearing in blocks”
“Fix/add taint analysis display - Tainted variables not highlighted properly”
“Review project docs without deleting - Update README.md, QUICK_START.md, etc. to reflect current capabilities”
“Add progress documentation - Document what's working vs. what needs work”
“Add pending features to todo list - After documentation review, identify next development priorities”
“Successfully pushed v1.0.3 to GitHub with enhanced dataflow analysis (completed)”

Follow these steps in order, verifying each change builds and runs cleanly, and use the todo items to help track remaining work.
```

Copy, paste, and give that prompt to the next Cursor instance to continue development from v1.0.3 onward.
