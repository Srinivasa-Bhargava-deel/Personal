## 🔧 Technical Details

### The Bug That Was Fixed

**Problem**: Variable definitions from declaration statements were not being captured by the reaching definitions analyzer.

Example:
```cpp
int result = n * factorial(n - 1);  // 'result' definition was NOT captured
```

**Root Cause**: The `analyzeStatementVariables()` method checked for assignments BEFORE declarations, so statements with type keywords went into the assignment branch which then failed to match the LHS (because it contained the type keyword).

**Solution**: Restructured to check for declarations FIRST:

```typescript
// OLD (broken):
if (assignment) { /* fails for 'int result = ...' */ }
else if (declaration) { /* never reached */ }

// NEW (fixed):
const declMatch = match(/\b(int|float|double|...) ([a-zA-Z_].*) .../)
if (declMatch) { /* captures 'result' */ }
else if (assignment) { /* for plain assignments like 'x = y' */ }
```

### Results After Fix

**Before**:
```
[RD Analysis] Collected 0 total definitions in factorial
```

**After**:
```
[RD Analysis] Collected 1 total definitions in factorial
[RD Analysis] Found definition: result -> d0 in block 3
```

## ✅ Testing & Verification

### Tested Functions

All three functions from `example.cpp` verified:

1. **factorial()**
   - ✅ Definition captured: `result`
   - ✅ Propagation path: `3 -> 1 -> 0`
   - ✅ Liveness shows live variables

2. **processArray()**
   - ✅ Definition captured: `sum`
   - ✅ Propagation path: `3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 0`
   - ✅ Loop iterations tracked correctly

3. **main()**
   - ✅ Definitions captured: `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`
   - ✅ Propagation paths through branches
   - ✅ All reaches definitions working

### Verification Checklist

- ✅ Variables captured from declarations
- ✅ Propagation paths accurate and complete
- ✅ Liveness analysis still functional
- ✅ Taint analysis still functional
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Extension loads in VSCode
- ✅ CFG visualization renders correctly
- ✅ All three functions analyzed successfully
